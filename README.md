# Smart Inhaler Project 🚀

## Overview
The **Smart Inhaler Project** is an innovative healthcare device designed to assist patients with respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD.  
It enhances traditional inhalers by adding **digital health monitoring, dosage tracking, caregiver connectivity, and environmental sensing**.  
The goal is to improve patient adherence, safety, and provide actionable health data for caregivers and medical teams.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 💊 **Dosage Counter** – Tracks inhaler puffs and alerts when refills are needed.  
- ⏰ **Time-Based LED Alerts** – Reminds patients when it’s time to take medication.  
- 🎙 **Voice Alerts & Assistance** – Provides audio reminders and usage guidance.  
- 🌡 **Environmental Sensors** – Monitors air quality, temperature, humidity, and triggers warnings for unsafe conditions.  
- 📲 **Mobile App & Dashboard** – Patients, caregivers, and medical teams can monitor inhaler usage and health trends.  
- 🛡 **Role-Based Access** – Separate dashboards for patients, caregivers, and doctors.  
- 🔋 **Rechargeable Battery with Magnetic Charger** – Easy and safe recharging.
